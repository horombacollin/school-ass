      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We speak for business in our region,
        honestly, fearlessly, and with authority.

        We provide members with
        meaningful business intelligence,
        opportunities for growth, and
        links to local and international partners,
        suppliers, and markets.
        <br>
        Soweto Chamber of Commerce's vision is to be the voice and preeminent business chamber organisation, by offering superior value to its stakeholders, lobbies for and represents the collective interests, domestic and foreign, of Sowetan businesses. Our mission is to effectively protect and promote the interests of business.
        <br>
        <br>
        We represent the business interests by influencing policy and legislative development and regulation. We engage government and legislatures or regulators in respect of certain of the regulations or pieces of legislation that we think would not be conducive for our business members or the economy in general or job creation. We are consulted in a lot of the policy that government looks at.
